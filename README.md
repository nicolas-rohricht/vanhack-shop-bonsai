# vanhack-shop-bonsai
This repository is a project created to Bonsai Shop while participating of Vanhackaton recruitment fair.

My objective was to demonstrate my React Native skills while creating a frontend app running on Android.
I also used some of another and great technologies that I would like to mention, like Redux to manage the state of the app and Lottie to have some fun animations.

## Running the project

To run this app: 

1 - Download the entire app folder with git clone or download the zip archive, as you prefer.
2 - Access the root folder of the project and run according to your package manager: `npm install` or `yarn add`.
3 - Before running the project, I would you recommend to access the android folder and run `gradlew clean` until you got success on this comand.
4 - Run `react-native run-android` to run the project on a connected device or a opened simulator.

## Some notes

These project was created with mocked JSON's to show data in the entire app. As I'm learning some of backends stacks at this moment, currently I wouldn't have how to create an API to fill the app with data. So, my idea was to demonstrate some of Frontend skills and what I could do if being a part of an entire team, with another devs, designers, etc...
